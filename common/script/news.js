Probably the first one you will notice is that the old F-key tab switching shortcuts have been replaced with the browser's shortcuts (Alt + number on SeaMonkey and Linux Firefox, Control + number on Windows Firefox, and Command + number for Mac Firefox). The online/offline icon in the statusbar will also be easy to notice.", "Less clearly visible changes include the improvements to the text munger, which will now apply inline styles (like <b>*bold*</b>) with more consistency. Likewise, when <a href=\"" + linkBase + "faq/#colors\">sending of color codes</a> is enabled, the respective codes (%C, %B, etc.) will not be matched inside URLs, allowing them to be pasted without problems.

Nothing except the client version, and the name and version of the host app (Firefox, Mozilla, XULRunner) is sent - certainly nothing that could identify the user - and there is the option to not send the ping. This data should help us to idenify what people are doing with ChatZilla - do they run it on older versions of Mozilla, for example, and how long they take to upgrade to the newest release. We should also be able to estimate the number of active users, which is much more useful that the simple \"download count\" we currently have."]
